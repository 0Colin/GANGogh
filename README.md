# GANGogh

Note: Code heavily inspired and built off of the improved wasserstein GAN training code available and found at: https://github.com/igul222/improved_wgan_training

To run code:

Step 1 use scape_wiki.py and picStuff.py to create image data set of 64x64 pieces of art scraped from wikiart (might have to adjust the path they are downloaded to)

Step 2 update path of dataset in wikiartGenre.py file

Step 3 run GANGogh.py
